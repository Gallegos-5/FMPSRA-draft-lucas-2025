# Federal Model Policy Submission & Registry Act

**A blueprint for radical transparency and open participation in U.S. lawmaking.**

---
> **Why it matters:**  
> • **Any citizen can propose law—no gatekeepers**  
> • **Stops good ideas from dying in inboxes** (every draft is logged, searchable, and must be triaged)  
> • **Kills back-room rewrites** with full version history & public comment threads  
> • **Permanent public record** → future lawmakers build on, not duplicate, past work  
> • **First true “GitHub-for-policy” platform**—open APIs for researchers, journalists, and watchdogs

## Overview

The **Federal Model Policy Submission & Registry Act** creates a public, open-source platform (“registry”) for anyone—citizen, expert, or public servant—to propose, track, and comment on model federal legislation. It is the intake and triage engine for 21st-century, process-first governance.

## What Does the Submission Act Do?

- **Creates a National Policy Registry:**  
  All model legislation, policy suggestions, and drafts are filed in a searchable, version-controlled public platform.
- **Enables Open Participation:**  
  Anyone can submit, annotate, and comment on proposals, with transparent authorship and change history.
- **Triage & Similarity Scoring:**  
  Proposals are clustered, flagged for duplication, and surfaced for expert review or public deliberation.
- **Threaded Public Comment & Metadata:**  
  30-day comment windows, auto-tagging (subject, agency, cost, risk), and public DOI/archiving for every entry.
- **Export & API Access:**  
  Bulk downloads, open APIs, and automated notifications for downstream pilots or committee intake.
- **Sunlight by Default:**  
  All data is public, with redactions logged to a public ledger. Proposals not acted on within 60 days are automatically flagged and reported.
